			For this week, I officially started coding the Javascript for the game! I did two main things, creating the most fundamental base for the game - the playing area, as well as the paddles and the ball. Secondly, I also started coding the movement of the paddles. 
		</p>

		<p>
			For the player's paddle, I initially coded it to be draggable when the player's mouse is down. The player will be able to drag the paddle along the y-axis following mouseEvent.clientY, with the x-position of the paddle being kept the same. That didn't quite work out though, because I realised it's quite tiring to have to press the mouse down while playing the entirety of the game. As such, I simplified it to just having a listener for a mousemove event.
		</p>

		<p>
			For the PC's paddle, I found that the challenge we did in class on the beating heart came in handy. I created two functions, one for moving the pc paddle up, and the other for moving it down. Both of these functions contain a Raphael.animate that does the actual animation. I think it turned out alright. Hopefully the ball actually manages to hit it though.
		</p>

		<p>
			The plan for next week is to do a little coding everyday so that I can finish 99% of the project by the end of week 12, leaving week 13 with minor edits and debugging etc.
