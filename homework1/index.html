    	<h3> You wake up.</h3>

    	<p class="storytext">
    		The clearing around you is unfamiliar, strange. Birds caw overhead, and accompanying the rising cacophony, you hear the frantic beating of wings. You glance up. Crows. Hundreds and thousands of them. They are a mass above you, a looming shadow that moved. An inxeplicable throb of fear pervades you — the chemical clogging your veins and turning your blood into slush. The birds, you realise, are startled.

    		Before you know it, you are standing. Your legs quiver; whether from the grogginess of sleep or the adrenaline snaking through your body, you do not know.
