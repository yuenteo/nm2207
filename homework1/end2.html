		You are <b>stumped</b>. You are back at where you awoke, the grass and scattered trees a familiar sight. As the confusion sets in, it dawns on you that you have no idea where you are. <b>You cannot remember anything.</b> But with the crows flying further, and the presence behind you nearer, you cannot help but push aside your muddled thoughts. You have to act. Two options — you can once again choose to run, or you can forsake your instinct of flight and stay behind. <a href="index.html">Which will you choose</a>?
