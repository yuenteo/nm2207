			For this week, I did a little brainstorming about what I wanted to see come to live in my final project. We are given the choice to choose between: a game, an interactive story, an animation or an app for designing something. Of the four available choices, a game seems the most feasible in containing our must-have components. 

		</p>

		<p>
			Although my interest lies primarily in interactive stories, I think making a game for my final project would be a good idea. Admittedly, I didn't do too well this week when it came to the making-a-game assignment. It was a little hard for me to conceptualise the features and come up with the steps needed to make the game computationally. Making a game for my final project would be a much larger version of that tiny bit we did in class, and as terrifying as that sounds, it also sounds pretty fun. I'll have more time to work with this assignment, so hopefully that gives me more time to think through what I need in my game.

			For now, I think I'll start with creating the very basic layout for my final project page - we're in need of a grid layout anyway. Game-wise, I'm thinking of creating something like air hockey? I'm not sure how difficult that'll be though. However, I probably have to modify the game to a one-player version instead of the usual two-player ones that we are used to. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Either way, it's a good idea to start on this project early. Knowing from just the challenges and homework alone how long coding can take, the final project will probably be far worse than that (and by worse, I really mean that it will probably take ten times as long to craft).
